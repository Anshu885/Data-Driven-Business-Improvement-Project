In the beginning, the case was just data for a company that did not indicate any useful information that 
would help decision-makers. In this case, I had to ask questions that could help extract and explore 
information that would help decision-makers improve and evaluate performance. But before that, I did 
some operations in the data to help me to analyze it accurately:
• Understand the data.
• Clean the data “By power query”.
• insert some calculation and columns like “COGS” cost of goods sold by power query.
• Modeling the data and adding some measures and other columns to help me in analysis
